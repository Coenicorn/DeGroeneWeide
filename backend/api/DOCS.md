# API Documentation

This API has autogenerated documentation! Custom-written for this product, not tested, possibly unclear and **totally awesome**!

View the README.md in every route's source folder or view the page on github to see the documentation (markdown parser recommended)!

## ![public](https://github.com/Coenicorn/DeGroeneWeide/blob/main/backend/docgen/public.png?raw=true) and ![private](https://github.com/Coenicorn/DeGroeneWeide/blob/main/backend/docgen/private.png?raw=true) routes

The API also specified public and private routes. Public routes can be accessed by anyone that has access to the public site and/or server, and private routes can only be accessed with an API key

### dev environment

In the dev environment, all routes are public. This means that you don't need an API key to call these routes when server environment is `dev` (`ENVIRONMENT=dev node index.js` *OR* `npm run dev` *OR* `ENVIRONMENT=dev`[.env] + `node index.js`)
